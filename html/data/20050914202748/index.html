<p>Swing is a powerful toolkit for building desktop applications, but
quite often Swing gets a bad reputation for sins of the past. Many
times, I've heard, "Swing is slow," "Swing is ugly," and "Swing is too
hard." A lot has changed in the almost ten years since Swing was first
designed. Chris Adamson and I wrote <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/swinghks/">Swing Hacks</a> to show that you can make fast, attractive, and usable applications quite easily. You just need to know a few tricks.</p>

<p>
This article will show you six undocumented features, classes, and
properties that let you hack into Swing. I've based the article on
hacks that didn't make it into <i>Swing Hacks</i>
for one reason or another. Some of them were too short to be full hacks
on their own. Some didn't fit nicely into a particular chapter. Some
are new things I've learned since publishing the book (technology
stands still for no one). Fortunately, the internet provides a way to
keep up with the latest developments. As always, please remember that
undocumented features are JVM-platform-and-version-dependent. They
could disappear in a new version, so use them carefully and always have
backup behavior ready.</p>

<p>
Every frame will show up in the Windows task bar with its own icon. If you are
using Windows XP, then the application icons may collapse together, but they are
still there. However, if you subclass <code>java.awt.Window</code> instead of <code>java.awt.Frame</code>,
then your window will not show up in the taskbar or the <code>Alt</code>-<code>Tab</code> hotswitcher.
This is because the window won't be registered as a full "application window"
that the operating system treats with special care. Instead, the window will be
more like a dialog box. 
</p>

<p>
The disadvantage of directly subclassing <code>Window</code> is
that
you won't get any window decorations. The title bar and maximize,
minimize, and
resize buttons will be missing. Even the border will be gone. However,
depending
on your use, this might not be a problem. Toolbar palettes, for
example, are
fine without borders and should properly be hidden from the taskbar.
Also, the recent trend towards mini-application development (Tiger
Dashboard, Yahoo Widgets) suggest that the lack of a title bar won't be
a problem.
</p>

<h3>Make Mac OS X Windows Transparent (For Real)</h3>

<p>Mac OS X has a graphics API called Quartz that makes it very easy to
create translucency effects. This API isn't directly accessible from
Java, but Apple's developers did provide a really nice feature that
uses Quartz. If you make the background of your frame partially
transparent, the desktop and other applications will show through. For
example, if you had a frame with a few buttons on it, you could call
this right before you set the frame:
</p>

<pre><code>frame.setBackground(new Color(0, 0, 0, 0));</code></pre>

<p>This will make the background of the frame completely transparent,
allowing other programs to shine through the gaps between the buttons.
This line will make the background be red with 50 percent translucency,
so the background will be partially visible and tinted through the
frame.
</p>

<pre><code>frame.setBackground(new Color(1, 0, 0, 0.5f));</code></pre>

<p>The background setting only affects the frame itself, not the
components of the frame. If you want those to be transparent, you will
need to set their background colors individually. You could also use
this effect to create a rounded window by using a PNG image with
transparent sections as the background of your main panel. Then the
background would shine through the transparent sections, creating the
illusion of a shaped window.
</p>

<h3>Bounce the Mac OS X Dock Icon</h3>

<p>Mac OS X introduced a new form of alert: bouncing the dock icon.
This is the icon on the bottom of the screen (depending on your setup)
that represents your application. You can make this icon bounce when
you wish to alert the user. A single bounce represents a simple
notification, such as the arrival of new mail. A continuous bounce
represents a serious request for the user's attention (a failed disk
write would fall into this category). Since this is a Mac-specific
feature, there is no standard API for it, and Apple chose not to add it
to their official API. However, there is an undocumented class that can
do the job.
</p>

<p>Apple has wrapped all of their Cocoa APIs with Java classes. These
classes have virtually no documentation, but by referring to the Cocoa
APIs they came from, you can usually figure them out. The <code>com.apple.cocoa.application</code> package contains an <code>NSApplication</code> object that has lots of useful methods. In particular, you want the <code>requestUserAttention()</code> method, which will make the dock icon bounce.
</p>

<pre><code>
import com.apple.cocoa.application.*;
// ... 
public void bounceDock() {
	NSApplication app = NSApplication.sharedApplication();
	int id = app.requestUserAttention(
				NSApplication.UserAttentionRequestCritical);
}
// ...
</code></pre>

<p>
<code>NSApplication</code> has a static method to get the singleton that represents the application. You can then call the <code>requestUserAttention()</code> method with the constant <code>NSApplication.UserAttentionRequestCritical</code> to make the dock bounce continuously. You can use other constants for other behaviors.  The return value can be passed to the <code>cancelUserAttentionRequest()</code> method to cancel the alert once the user has responded. Be sure to add the <em>/System/Library/Java/</em> directory to your classpath when compiling, so that <code>javac</code> will find the Cocoa wrapper classes.

<h3>Get Large File Icons</h3>

<p>
Not to leave Windows lonely, here is an undocumented class that will let you
obtain large desktop icons and other file information. The <code>FileSystemView</code> only
provides access to file icons of a "default" size, which usually means 16 by 16
pixels. If you look at your operating system desktop, however, you may see icons
that are much bigger, with more detail. There is no standardized way of getting
to the larger icons, but on Windows you can use the hidden class called
<code>sun.awt.shell.ShellFolder</code> to retrieve larger (32 by 32) desktop file icons. This
class is only available in Sun's JVM, so it won't work with other vendors, or on
other platforms.
</p>

<p>
The code below will take a filename and show the file's large icon in a window.
</p>

<pre><code>
public class LargeIconTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a File instance of an existing file
        File file = new File(args[0]);
        
        // Get metadata and create an icon
        sun.awt.shell.ShellFolder sf =
                sun.awt.shell.ShellFolder.getShellFolder(file);
        Icon icon = new ImageIcon(sf.getIcon(true));
        System.out.println("type = " + sf.getFolderType());
    
        // show the icon
        JLabel label = new JLabel(icon);
        JFrame frame = new JFrame();
        frame.getContentPane().add(label);
        frame.pack();
        frame.show();
    
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>ShellFolder</code> is a wrapper for the metadata of the selected file. From
this object, you can retrieve both the icon and a text description of the file's
type. If you run this on an MP3 file, it might print the string <code>"type =
MPEG Layer 3 Audio"</code> and show a 32 by 32 pixel iTunes MP3 icon. </p>


<h3>Change the Look and Feel of an App from the Command Line</h3>

<p>Sometimes, Swing applications don't provide a way to change a look
and feel at runtime. When using an application like this, you can
override the default look and feel with your own setting from the
command line using the <code>swing.defaultlaf</code> property.
</p>

<pre><code>java -Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel 
   myapp.MainClass</code></pre>

<p>You can also use this technique to apply a new look and feel that the original developer never thought of.
</p>

<h3>Hacks for the Metal Look and Feel</h3>

<p>There are a variety of undocumented properties that control the look of
Metal, Swing's cross-platform look and feel. JTree nodes can have lines
connecting children to their parent, but depending on your current setup, the
lines may or may not be showing. You can control the lines with a client
property called <code>JTree.lineStyle</code>. Add this code after you create
your JTree. </p>

<pre><code>// show the lines in a JTree
tree.putClientProperty("JTree.lineStyle", "Angled");
// hide the lines in a jtree
tree.putClientProperty("JTree.lineStyle", "None");</code></pre>

<p>One of the big complaints about Metal is that the menus and labels
use bold fonts. With another quick undocumented system property, you
can turn that off.
</p>

<pre><code>java -Dswing.boldMetal=false myapp.MainClass</code></pre>
<p>You can also turn on the rollover for <code>JToolBar</code> buttons
by using a secret property. A rollover is useful because it gives the
user visual feedback that the mouse cursor is over the right place.
Given the size of the typical toolbar button, this feedback is
essential.</p>

<pre><code>toolbar.putClientProperty("JToolBar.isRollover",Boolean.TRUE);</code></pre>

<p>
There is a longer (though, by no means comprehensive) list of properties on <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Javadesktop/SecretSwingProperties">this wiki page</a>.
Swing, and Metal in particular, has lots of undocumented system
properties. As you discover them, please add your own comments to the
wiki page. Also remember that these are undocumented for a reason, and
could easily change or go away in the future. Use them at your own risk.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Swing is a powerful toolkit with lots of hidden features that you
can use to bring out the best in your application. This article
documents just a few interesting techniques. <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/swinghks/">Swing Hacks</a>
from O'Reilly covers another 100 hacks to improve your software. None
of the techniques I've shown are required features, but they can add a
level of polish that will make your apps stand out from the rest. And
in a crowded software marketplace, anything that makes your program
better than the competition is a good thing.</p>
